- Sign up and log in to access the platform.
- Add products with a title, description, visual, funny use case, and a link for further exploration.
- Browse and search for products added by others.
- Manage their added products via the dashboard.
- Stay logged in even after closing the website until they manually log out.

The website is now fully backed by **Supabase**, enabling global storage and accessibility of all added products.
