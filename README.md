## About the Project

This website allows users to upload and browse products (referred to as "things" for fun). Users can:

- Add products with a title, description, visual, funny use case, and a link for further exploration.
- Browse and search for products added by others.
- Discover quirky and creative ideas shared by the community.

Currently, the website features local storage for saving data. A backend connection will be integrated soon to enable better functionality and global accessibility.

## Features

1. **Add Your Thing:**
   - Upload a product (or "thing") with:
     - Title
     - Description
     - Funny use case
     - Tags for searchability
     - Image and product link

2. **Find a Thing:**
   - Search for items using keywords.
   - Randomly browse items using the "spawn" feature.
   - Click on the rocket icon for more information of the thing.
   - Click the title of any product to get a detailed view of the thing.
   - You can navigate the products by clicking next and prev.

3. **Local Storage:**
   - All products are saved locally on the user's device after adding them and can be seen in the "find a thing" section.
