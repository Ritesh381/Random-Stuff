## About the Project

This website allows users to upload and browse products (referred to as "things" for fun). Users can:

- Sign up and log in to their accounts.
- Add products with a title, description, visual, funny use case, and a link for further exploration.
- Browse and search for products added by others.
- Manage their own products via the **Dashboard** (edit/delete options available).
- Stay logged in even after closing the website (until they manually log out).

Now, all data is stored online using **Supabase**, meaning all users can see each other's posts. Local storage is no longer used.
